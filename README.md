# 3D Game Template (TypeScript)

This repository provides a simple starting point for a browser-based 3D game using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the TypeScript files:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or run a simple static server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will compile `src/main.ts` to `dist/main.js` and serve `index.html` so you can see a rotating cube.

Feel free to modify `src/main.ts` to begin creating your own 3D game.
